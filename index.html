    <div class="intro"><p><b>Dixie State University is on the cusp of greatness.</b> <br>
      Giant strides have been taken these last few years, in a new identity and mascot, greater community engagement, new buildings and dorms, and a growing Student Government among other things. As a result, our student population had the largest amount of growth compared to any other institution in Utah, community participation and pride has increased significantly, and fantastic initiatives have been allowed to take place on campus which enrich students lives and make their education even better.<br><br>
      A lot of work has been done, but there is still a lot work to be done. Our next Student Body President is going to have to work hard to continue initiatives already set in place, and introduce new initiatives and goals in order to build upon the ground work that has been laid. I am the Student Body President that can and will do it. I have worked in every facet of this organization, worked with administration and other organizations on campus, and called Dixie State home for the better part of 18 years.<br><br>
      <b>My name is Moses Campbell. <br> 
      I am running for Student Body President.</b>

        <p><b><i>CHEAPER TEXTBOOKS (OER)</i></b></p>
        <p>I am tired of paying ridiculous amounts of money for textbooks I will never use again. Open Educational Resources (or OER), are an initiative started by our current VP of Academics, that I intend to see through the finish line. What it technically means is low-cost or free open source textbook options for our general education classes. What it <i>really</i> means is less money spent on textbooks, which means more money for you to spend on literally anything else. <a href="votemoses.com/oer" target="new">You can read more about my plan here.</a></p>

        <p><b><i>MENTAL HEALTH</i></b></p>
        <p>Utah currently ranks 5 in the country for deaths by suicide, with 15% of those happening to 20-34 year olds. Thats not okay. There are several things we can do to combat this, and make sure our campus retains the lowest rate of suicide in the state. Through the introduction of the first ever collegiate Hope Squad, a lowering of Health and Wellness Center costs, and an expansion of the services offered on campus; we can work together to reduce suicide rates, increase overall mental health, and make our campus a safer, more positive place to live.</p>

        <p><b><i>TRANSPARENCY</i></b></p>
        <p>Nothing bums me out more than someone asking what Student Government even does. Student Government does an incredible amount of work for the student association (aka, every student at DSU). Its more than planning parties, its initiatives, bills, club organization, student representation, working with faculty and administration; and tons more. An increase in transparency and awareness will not only inform students, but make them more aware of what opportunities are present for them to take advantage of. Do you have questions about what we do? <a href="votemoses.com/questions" target="new">Hit me up.</a></p>

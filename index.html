    <div class="intro"><p><b>Dixie State University is on the cusp of greatness.</b> <br>
      Giant strides have been taken these last few years, in a new identity and mascot, greater community engagement, new buildings and dorms, and a growing Student Government among other things. As a result, our student population had the largest amount of growth compared to any other institution in Utah, community participation and pride has increased significantly, and fantastic initiatives have been allowed to take place on campus which enrich students lives and make their education even better.<br><br>
      A lot of work has been done, but there is still a lot work to be done. Our next Student Body President is going to have to work hard to continue initiatives already set in place, and introduce new initiatives and goals in order to build upon the ground work that has been laid. I am the Student Body President that can and will do it. I have worked in every facet of this organization, worked with administration and other organizations on campus, and called Dixie State home for the better part of 18 years.<br><br>
      <b>My name is Moses Campbell. <br> 
      I am running for Student Body President.</b>
